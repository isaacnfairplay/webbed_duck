# Pseudo Auth & Sharing Demo (Placeholder)

See the detailed task instructions in `../../to-do/pseudo-auth-demo.md`.

This directory will eventually contain:
- `demo.md` showing pseudo session creation, inspection, and teardown.
- Share request examples tied to the pseudo session cookie.
- Notes that reinforce the securable positioning and cleanup reminders.
