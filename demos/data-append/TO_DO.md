# Data Append Demo (Automation Placeholder)

See the generator requirements in `../../to-do/data-append-demo.md`.

This directory must only contain assets that are produced by or power an
automated generator, never hand-written walkthrough prose. The eventual
contents include:
- A runnable entry point (for example `generate_demo.py`) that executes the
  append scenario against the real server/runtime and captures every command
  and response from live runs.
- The generated `demo.md` file emitted by that entry point, rebuilt on every
  execution to reflect current behaviour.
- Any supporting fixtures or helper modules required to drive the scenario.

Do not stage manually edited transcripts or screenshots—rerun the generator to
refresh outputs instead.
