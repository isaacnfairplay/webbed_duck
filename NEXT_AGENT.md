# Handoff Notes for Next Maintainer

## Completed in this session
- Fixed the packaging configuration (`pyproject.toml`) so wheels now bundle the
  `webbed_duck` package hierarchy instead of emitting top-level `core/`,
  `plugins/`, and `server/` modules. Verified by building from source, forcing a
  reinstall (`pip install --force-reinstall .`), and running the CLI end to end.
- Added `tests/test_packaging.py` to build a wheel via `pip wheel` and assert the
  archive includes `webbed_duck/__init__.py` without leaking modules at the
  repository root.
- Added an optional `[test]` dependency set in `pyproject.toml` (currently only
  `build>=1.2`) for easier local setup when running the packaging test.
- Regenerated `routes_build/hello.py` so the compiled artifact captures all
  metadata (formats, postprocessors, directives) produced by the current
  compiler.
- Documented the changes in `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased) and captured a branch
  summary in `docs/status/branch-changelog.md` per instructions.
- Demonstrated the release flow: built the wheel, `pip install --force-reinstall .`,
  ran `webbed-duck serve`, and exercised `/hello` (JSON + `?format=html_c`) via
  `curl`.

## Pending / needs attention
- No known blockers for 0.4.0 after the packaging fix. Keep an eye on the new
  packaging test; it runs `pip wheel` which downloads build dependencies, so CI
  caches would be helpful for speed.
- Future hardening ideas (not started): add smoke tests that run the installed
  CLI in a clean virtualenv and assert responses. Not required for 0.4.0.

## Files touched this round
- `pyproject.toml`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/status/branch-changelog.md`
- `routes_build/hello.py`
- `tests/test_packaging.py`

## Outstanding TODO comments
- None found via ripgrep.

## Test / coverage status
- `pytest` (30 tests including new packaging check) — passes locally.
- Manual E2E: `pip install --force-reinstall .`, `webbed-duck serve`, `curl` for
  `/hello` JSON and HTML cards.

## Known quirks / bugs
- `tests/test_packaging.py` calls `pip wheel`, so it depends on network access
  to fetch build requirements (`setuptools`, `wheel`). Provide caching or mirror
  if running in restricted environments.
- Server remains “securable” but not hardened (see `AGENTS.md`); deploy behind a
  proxy with TLS/auth if going beyond intranet use.
