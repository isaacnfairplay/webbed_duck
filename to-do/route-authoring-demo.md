# TODO: Route Authoring & Serving Demo

- **Demo directory:** `demos/route-authoring/`
- **Scenario focus:** Show how a TOML+SQL route compiles and is served through the CLI, including format negotiation.
- **What the finished demo should include:**
  1. Step-by-step commands for `webbed-duck compile` and `webbed-duck serve` against the sample sources.
  2. Example HTTP requests (HTML, CSV, Arrow) with captured outputs or screenshots.
  3. Notes on how the demo route maps back to source files in `routes_src/`.
  4. Guidance for resetting build/runtime directories before and after the walkthrough.
- **Artifacts to produce:** `demos/route-authoring/demo.md` with CLI transcripts, request snippets, and explanatory captions.

Document assumptions (e.g., ports, expected datasets) so another contributor can replay the demo verbatim.
