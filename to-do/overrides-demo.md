# TODO: Overrides & Annotations Demo

- **Demo directory:** `demos/overrides/`
- **Scenario focus:** Illustrate creating, listing, and observing per-cell overrides via `/routes/{id}/overrides`.
- **What the finished demo should include:**
  1. Example POST payloads that adjust a comment or note column, including author metadata.
  2. Screenshots or responses showing the override applied in the rendered HTML view.
  3. Retrieval of stored overrides to emphasize the audit trail (timestamp, author hash).
  4. Discussion of key column requirements and rollback/removal options.
- **Artifacts to produce:** `demos/overrides/demo.md` with HTTP transcripts, UI captures, and explanatory text.

Highlight any pre-demo setup (e.g., ensuring the route exposes the annotated column) so the instructions remain reproducible.
