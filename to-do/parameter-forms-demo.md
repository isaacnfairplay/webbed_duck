# TODO: Parameter Forms & Progressive UI Demo

- **Demo directory:** `demos/parameter-forms/`
- **Scenario focus:** Highlight the server-rendered parameter form, progressive enhancement widgets, and non-JavaScript submission path.
- **What the finished demo should include:**
  1. Screenshots or HTML captures of the `/hello` form with and without JavaScript enabled.
  2. A walkthrough of adjusting parameters and observing the refreshed results.
  3. Callouts for metadata options like `show_params`, `invariant_filters`, and pagination fields.
  4. Tips for inspecting the network requests to confirm graceful degradation.
- **Artifacts to produce:** `demos/parameter-forms/demo.md` combining narrative, command snippets, and asset references.

Make sure to mention any browser settings or developer tools required to replicate the demo faithfully.
